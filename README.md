# Mancala

The classic game of mancala.

## Purpose

This repo serves two purposes to me:
1. Just some practice writing a project with Rust.
2. It gives me some space to explore some interesting questions I have about mancala.

## Things to explore

Mancala is interesting to me because it is small enough to be approachable, but complex enough to introduce challenges.

Some things I might try to explore as a self-learning exercise:

__Technical__
1. How do I parallelize different tasks
2. How fast can I make my model of Mancala?
   a. What design decisions affect this?
3. How can I design APIs to be flexible?
4. When making an engine, what tradeoffs might I find between memory vs. compute?
5. Could I write an engine that works well on an embedded system? [stretch-goal]
6. How can I visualize exploring the various gamestates? [webasm?]

__Theoretical__
1. What is the shortest possible game(s)?
    - How does this different between different variants of Mancala?
2. What are the most stones that can fit go into a single pit?
3. What is the minimum number stones that can go into a scoring pit?
4. When is the earliest move where a state can be reached by different sequences of actions?
5. What is the largest possible capture?
6. What is the longest game of mancala?
7. How many possible gamestates are there in Mancala?
8. How many possible games are there in Mancala?

I suspect some of these are known, some probably are not.
Those that are are probably not easily found anyways.
